## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development (Two Terminals)

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
npm run dev:server
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Development (Single Command)

Run both frontend and backend together:

```bash
npm run dev:full
```

### Share with Friends

**Same WiFi (Local Network):**

1. Find your local IP:
   - **Windows**: `ipconfig` (look for IPv4 Address)
   - **Mac/Linux**: `ifconfig` (look for inet)

2. Share: `http://YOUR_IP:5173`

Example: `http://192.168.1.100:5173`

**Remote Play (Over Internet):**

For friends NOT on your WiFi, use ngrok:

```bash
# Terminal 3: Start ngrok tunnel
ngrok http 5173
```

Share the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc-xyz.ngrok-free.dev`)

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Solo Fun**: Open random packs and see what you pull
- **Sealed Events**: Draft with friends remotely
- **Deck Testing**: Build sealed pools and export for testing
- **Learning**: See realistic pack distributions
- **Price Checking**: View real-time card prices

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (optional):

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
PORT=3001
```

### Backend Settings

- **Event Cleanup**: Old events auto-delete after 24 hours
- **Storage**: Events saved to `./data/events/`; game table state is saved to `./data/games/`
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates for multiplayer

### Game Table Multiplayer Notes

- Sandbox and multiplayer now share the same bulk interaction model for multi-select tap, zone moves, and counters.
- Multiplayer bulk actions are processed atomically (`cards:tap`, `cards:zone`, `cards:counter`) to reduce race conditions from per-card emits.
- Game code lookup skips malformed JSON files in `data/games` instead of failing the whole scan.

## 📝 Data Persistence

Sealed events are saved as JSON files in `data/events/`:
- Events persist across server restarts
- Players can rejoin events
- Auto-cleanup prevents disk bloat
